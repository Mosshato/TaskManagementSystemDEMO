My first Java project, a task management system for a small/medium bussines.
A practical application of OOP, database interaction, and server connectivity.

This project demonstrates core Java concepts through:

Object-Oriented Programming: Well-structured classes and objects.
Database Integration: Connection to a database for data retrieval and manipulation.
Server Communication: Network interaction for data exchange.
